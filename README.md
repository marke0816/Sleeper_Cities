## Version Control
To check which branch you are on, use 
```
git branch
```

To switch branches, use
```
git checkout <branch name>
```

Please refer to the [Github reference guide](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/546/pages/20-dot-1-2-build-your-foundation?module_item_id=147062) in module 20.1.2 for version control protocols.  Be sure you are working in your own branch before making any changes or commits.

I've created branches for each of the four roles.  Please push changes to your own branch, and we'll merge them into the main branch once each role has completed their duties for the week.
